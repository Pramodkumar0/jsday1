    <p>1.Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</p>
    Ans: <ul>
        <li>== is used for comparison between two variables irrespective of the datatype of variable.</li>
        <li>=== is used for comparision between two variables but this will check strict type, which means it will check datatype and compare two values.</li>
    </ul>
    Ex:<pre>if (number == 100)  // Here Comparision between two values using ==. It will compare irrespective of datatype of variable
        alert("Both are equal");    
     else    
        alert("Both are not equal"); 
    </pre>

    Ex: <pre>
        if (number === 100)  // Here Comparision between two values using ===. It will compare strict check means it will check datatype as well.
   alert("Both are equal");      
else      
   alert("Both are not equal"); 
    </pre>

    <p>2.What is the spread operator?</p>
    Ans:<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spread syntax (...)</li> 
        <li>Allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments </li>
    </ul>
    Example:
    <pre>const array = [1, 2, 3];
        const obj = { ...array }; // { 0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3 }</pre>
    <hr>
    <p>3.What are the differences between var, let and const?</p>
    Ans:
   <p>Let</p>  <ul>
        <li>The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).</li>

           <li>Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.</li> 
            
           <li>Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.</li> 
            
           <li>Variables defined with let have Block Scope.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>var</p>
    <ul>
            <li>Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.</li>
           <li> Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.</li>            
           <li>Variables defined with const have Block Scope.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>const</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

            In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:</li>
            <li>var x = 5; <br> 
                var y = 6; <br>
                var z = x + y;</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
<p>4.What is execution context</p>
<ul>
    <li>Execution context is a concept in the language </li>
       <li>Spec that—in layman's terms—roughly equates to the 'environment'.</li>
       <li>A function executes in; that is, variable scope (and the scope chain, variables in closures from outer scopes),</li>  
       <li>Function arguments, and the value of the this object.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>5.What is meant by first class functions?</p>
<ul>
    <li>A programming language is said to have First-class functions</li>
    <li>if functions in that language are treated like other variables.</li>
    <li>functions can be assigned to any other variable or passed as an argument or can be returned by another function</li>
    <li>JavaScript treat function as a first-class-citizens. </li>
    <li>This means that functions are simply a value and are just another type of object.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>6.What are closures? Give an example of closure</p>
<ul>
    <li>Basically a closure function </li>
    <li>That can access to the variables declared in the outer context,including global variables.</li>
    <li>A Closure is a named or anonymous function </li>
    <li>Defined within the context of an object or any other function, which preserves and access to the context where it was declared</li>
    <br>
    Example:<pre>var counter = 0;
        function increase() {
            counter += 1;  // increment its current value.
            console.log(counter);
        }
         
        increase();
        increase();
        increase()</pre>
</ul>
<p>7.Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</p>
Ans:  Call()<pre>
    function test(a,b){
        console.log(a,b)
        console.log(this)
    }
    test.call({name: "pramod"} 10,20)
</pre>
apply() <pre>
    function test(a,b){
        console.log(a,b)
        console.log(this)
    }
    test.call({name: "pramod"})
    test.apply({name:"p"},[10,33])

</pre>
bind()<pre>
    
    let print = function()
    {
        console.log(this.firstname + this.name +this.lastname )
    }

    let givingvalues = print.bind({name: "pramod",firstname: "pusala",lastname: "kumar"})
       
    console.log(print)
    givingvalues()
</pre>
<br>
<pre>
    let a = function(){
        console.log(this)
    }
    let b = a.bind({name: "pp",age:44})
    b()
  
</pre>
<script>
    
    let print = function()
    {console.log(this)}

    let givingvalues = print.bind({name: "pramod",firstname: "pusala",lastname: "kumar"})
    console.log(print)
    givingvalues()

    let a = function(){
        console.log(this)
    }
    let b = a.bind({name: "pp",age:44})
    b()
